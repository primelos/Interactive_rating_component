## My Process

From the example I figured out how I wanted to structure my app div, img, p.
This was a small app and opted to manually add 1-5 on screen instead of iterating using map. I decided on styled-components because I like to be able to see my styles on the same page as I build and make adjustments.

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router v6](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

- React Router changed the Switch for Routes. In Route you use element instead of component
